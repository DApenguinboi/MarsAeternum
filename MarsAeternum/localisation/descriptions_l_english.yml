    POLITICS_ROBERTO_ESCUELA_DESC:0 "Fighting Bob as he is known, is beloved by many. Hailed as the protector of the Martian campesinos, he seeks to bring about a democratic socialist people's republic to Mars and it was this vision that catapulted him into the leadership of the Martian Agrarian Union. Now he is faced with a choice, stand united with his socialist comrades despite their differences or fight for his own vision for Mars?"
    POLITICS_HORST_BUCKMAN_DESC:0 "Horst 'Bulldog' Buckman was born in Marston and served the United Solarian Interplanetary Congress as a peacekeeper in the Colonial Wars with Stav Morton and Bob Escuela before they all realized the cruelty of the system they served. While they believed communism could be achieved through the power of the union, Horst believed that it could be achieved democratically through the political arena. He returned to Marston as a hero and used his status to gain political office as an MP for the MNC and later a Senator of the Greator Marston Area as well as leader of the party. He became known as an agressive and savvy political operator, but he grew frustrated with the veto system that was held over Mars by Earth's governor. The final straw was the assassination of the provisional prime minister of Mars, the woman who was supposed to lead a nominally free government. He decided to create a new government that was based on the ideals of Old America and run it with the ideology of his historical heroes, George Washington and Gus Hall. He created this new government around Bill of Rights Socialism and based its capital in his home city. Now he waits for the response from the tyrannical Martian Colonial Authority and the inneffective Provisional Government of Mars."
